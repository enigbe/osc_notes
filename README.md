# Open Source Contribution Notes
This repository/space contains notes taken while working on open source projects. The notes are derived from repository study sessions, code reviews, pull request submissions, etc.

The notes capture my **current** understanding of concepts, are active, i.e. will be updated as my knowledge improves, and contain unpolished hand-drawn sketches for private consumption. If they ever get converted to articles, detailed contexts will be provided and the sketches will be cleaned-up.
